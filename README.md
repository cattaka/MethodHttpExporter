## Example

[Whole sample code you can get from here](https://github.com/cattaka/MethodHttpExporterSample)

When you have following class. It has a method that shows toast.
And  it has @ExportMethodHttp annotations.
ExportMethodHttp generates utility class named **SimpleToastHttpServer**.

```java
package net.cattaka.android.learnmethodhttpexporter;

import android.content.Context;
import android.widget.Toast;

import net.cattaka.util.methodhttpexporter.annotation.ExportMethodHttp;

/**
 * Created by cattaka on 14/09/19.
 */
@ExportMethodHttp
public class SimpleToast {
    private Context mContext;

    @ExportMethodHttpAttr
    public SimpleToast(Context mContext) {
        this.mContext = mContext;
    }

    @ExportMethodHttpAttr
    public String doToast(String text) {
        Toast.makeText(mContext, text, Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
        return "Succeed";
    }
}

```

Then, **SimpleToastHttpServer** class will generated by APT after build.
Next, You need to add code like following to **Application** class.
```java
public class MyApplication extends Application {
    @Override
    public void onCreate() {
        super.onCreate();
        {   // Create Development tool and run
            SimpleToast simpleToast = new SimpleToast(this);
            SimpleToastHttpServer server = new SimpleToastHttpServer(simpleToast);
            try {
                server.run(8090);   // port number of HttpServer
            } catch (IOException e) {
                throw new RuntimeException(e);
            }
        }
    }
}

```

That's all for editng code.
Try to access "http://localhost:8090/", you will see list of methods and forms.
And access "http://localhost:8090/doToast?text=helloFromBrowser",
you will see Toast that has "helloFromBrowser" message.
